\item[1.]
Let $f \varepsilon C(G)$, where $G$ is the open square defined by
$-1 < \hbox{\ Rez\ } < 1$ and $-1 < Imz < 1$. Suppose that
$$\int_\gamma fdz = 0$$
for all rectangular loops $\gamma$ in $G$ with one side contained in the
real axis. Prove that $f \varepsilon H(G)$.

\item[2.]
Evaluate
$$I_n = \int^\infty_0 \frac{dx}{1 = x^n} \hbox{\ for\ } n=2,3, \dots$$

\item[3.]
Let $G$ be a region in $\C$, and let $(f_n)$ be a uniformly bounded
sequence in $H(G)$. Suppose that the set
$$A = \{z \varepsilon G : \lim_n f_n (z) = 0\}$$
has a limit point in $G$. Prove that the $f_n$ converge to 0 uniformly
on compact subsets of $G$.

\item[4.]
Let $G$ be a region in $\C$, $f_n$ a sequence in $H(G)$, and
$f \varepsilon H(G)$. Suppose that the $f_n$ converge to $f$ uniformly
on compact subsets of $G$, that
$\{z \varepsilon \C : |z-a| \leq r\} \subset G$, and that $f$ has no
zero on the circle $|z-a| = r$. Prove that there exists an integer $N$ such
that for each $n > N$, $f_n$ and $f$ have the same number of zeros in
$D(a,r)$.

\item[5.]
Let $G$ be a region in $\C, f, g \varepsilon H(G)$, and $\varepsilon > 0$.
Suppose that $|f| \cdot |g|^\varepsilon$ attains a maximum on $G$. Prove
that $|f| \cdot |g|^\varepsilon$ is a constant on $G$.

\item[6.]
Let $G = \{z \varepsilon \C : \hbox{\ Rez\ } >0\}$,
$f \varepsilon C(\overline G)$, and $f \varepsilon H(G)$. Suppose that $f$
is bounded on the imaginary axis, and that
$|f(z)| / (1+|z|^t)$ is bounded on $G$ for each $t >0$. Prove that $f$ is
bounded on $G$.

\item[7.]
Let $G \subset \C$ be open, and $\alpha \varepsilon \C$. Suppose that there
exists $g \varepsilon H(G)$ such that $g(z)^2 = z- \alpha$ for all
$z$ in $G$. Prove that $\alpha$ belongs to an unbounded component of
$\C \backslash G$.

{\bf HINT:} You may use the fact (without proof) that if $B$ is a bounded
component of $\C \backslash G$, then there exists a bounded open subset
$V$ of $G$ such that $B \subset V$ and $\partial V \subset G$.

\item[8.]
State and prove the Harnack inequality for harmonic functions.

\item[9.]
Let $G$ be a region in $\C$, and let $u$ be a real-valued continuous
function on $G$. Suppose that for each $a \varepsilon G$, there exists
$R>0$ such that $D(a,R) \subset G$ and
$$2 \pi u (a) \leq \int^\pi_{-\pi} u(a+re^{it})dt \quad \forall r \varepsilon
  [0,R).$$

Prove:

(a) If $u$ attains a maximum on $G$, then $u$ is a constant on $G$.

(b) $u$ is subharmonic on $G$.

\item[10.]
Let $G$ be a region in $\C$. State four conditions each of which is equivalent
to the simple connectivity of $G$. Also prove their equivalence.

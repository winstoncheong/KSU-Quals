\item[1.]
Let $f$ be analytic on the open unit disc $D=D(0,1)$ in the sense that
$f^\prime$ exists and is continuous on $D$. Give an {\it ab inito}
proof that
$$\int_\gamma f(z) dz = 0$$
for every closed smooth curve $\gamma$ in $D$.

{\bf HINT:} Consider the derivative of
$$I(r) = \int_{r \gamma} f(z) dz,$$
where $(r\gamma) (t) = r \cdot \gamma (t)$.

\item[2.]
Evaluate
$$\phi_{|z| = 1} \frac{dz}{z^2 \sin z}$$
by means of the Cauchy Redidue Theorem.

\item[3.]
Let $f$ be analytic and bounded on the punctured disc
$$D_0 = \{z \varepsilon \C :0 < |z-z_0| < R\}.$$
Prove that $f$ has a removable singularity at $z_0$.

\item[4.]
Prove that each polynomial $P$ of the form
$$P(z) = z^n + a_{n-1} z^{n-1} + \dots + a_0$$
satisfies
$$\sup \{|P(z)| : |z| \leq 1\} \geq 1.$$

\item[5.]
Suppose that $f$ is an entire function such that
$$Re f(z) \leq |z|^n$$
for some natural number $n$ and all $z$ with sufficiently large $|z|$.
Prove that $f$ is a polynomial.

\item[6.]
Let $f$ be an entire function of finite order. Suppose $f$ has only
finitely many zeros. Prove that $f = Qe^P$ for some polynomials $P$ and $Q$.

{\bf HINT:} Use problem 5.

\item[7.]
Let $f$ be a continuous function on $(0,1] \times D$, where $D = D(0,1)$.
Suppose:

\item[\quad] (i)
For each $t$ in $[0,1], f(t,z) = 0$ has a unique soultion $z$ in $D$, and

\item[\quad] (ii)
For each {\it rational} number $t$ in $[0,1], f(t, \cdot)$ is
analytic on $D$.

Prove that there exists a continuous function $t \to z(t) : [0,1] \to D$
such that $f(t, z(t)) = 0$ for all $t$ in $[0,1]$.

{\bf HINT:} First show that for {\it every} $t$ in $[0,1], f(t, \cdot)$ is
analytic on $D$.

\item[8.]
The Riemann zeta function is defined by
$$\zeta (z) = \sum^\infty_{n=1} n^{-z} \quad (\hbox{Re\ } z > 1),$$
where $n^{-z} = \exp (-z \log n)$ for all $n$. Prove that $\zeta$ is
well-defined and analytic for $\hbox{Re\ } z >1$.

\item[9.]
Prove or disprove the existence of a double sequence $(a_{k,n})$ of complex
numbers such that

\item[\quad] (a)
$\sum^\infty_{k=1} |a_{k,n} |\leq C$ for all $n = 1,2, \dots$; and

\item[\quad] (b)
$\lim_n \sin \left(\sum^\infty_{k=1} a_{k,n} z^k \right) = 1$
for all $z$ in $K$,

where $C$ is a finite constant and $K = \{ 1/2 + l/m : m = 3,4, \dots\}.$

{\bf HINT:} Montel's theorem.

\item[10.]
Let $G$ be a nonempty open connected subset of $\C$. State at least three
conditions each of which is equivalent to the simple connectedness
of $G$, and prove their equivalence.

\item[1.]
Let $G= \{a + bi : a, b \in \Bbb Z\}$. Does
$\sum_{\substack{z \in G \\ z \neq 0}} \frac{1}{|z|^2}$
converge or diverge?

\item[2.]
Suppose $f$ is even and entire. Show $g(z) = f(\sqrt{z})$ is entire.

\item[3.]
Suppose $f$ is entire and there exist $\eta_1, \eta_2 > 0$ such that
$|z|> \eta_1$ implies $|f(z)|>\eta_2$. Show $f$ is a polynomial.

\item[4.]
Evaluate $\int^\infty_0 x(x^2 + 1)^{-2} \sin (x) dx$.

\item[5.]
Find a conformal mapping from $\{x + iy : |y| < \frac{\pi}{2} \}$ onto
$\{u + iv : v < u^2\}$.
(Hint: What is the action of $w = z^2$ on horizontal lines?)

\item[6.]
Write the function $\frac{1}{1-z} + \frac{3}{3-z}$ as a Laurent series
centered at $z_0 = 0$ valid in some region which contains the point $z=2$.
What is the domain of convergence for this series?

\item[7.]
Prove that the equation $e^z=2z+1$ has exactly one root in $|z|<1$.

\item[8.]
It is desired to approximate $\frac{1}{z}$ on $|z|=1$ by a function $f(z)$
which is analytic on $|z| \leq 1$. Show that the maximum error is at least
one, that is, show $\max_{|z|=1} |\frac{1}{z} - f(z)| \geq 1$.

\item[9.]
Suppose $f:U \to S$ is conformal, onto, and one-to-one, where $U$ is the unit
disk and $S$ is a square centered at 0. Suppose also $f(0) = 0$. Prove that
$f(iz) = if(z)$ and that if $f(z) = \sum^\infty_{n=0} c_nz^n$, then
$c_n = 0$ unless $n-1$ is a multiple of $4$. (Hint: Consider
$f^{-1} (if(z))$.)

\item[10.]
Show that $f(z) = \sum^\infty_{n=1} \frac{1}{n^z}$ defines an analytic
function in the domian $\hbox{Rez} >1$.

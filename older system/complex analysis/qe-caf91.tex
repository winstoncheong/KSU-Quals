$\Bbb R$ is the set of real numbers, $\Bbb C$, the set of complex numbers
$D(a, \rho) := \{ z \in \Bbb C : |z-a| < \rho\}$ for any
$a \in \Bbb C, 0 < \rho \in \Bbb R, \Bbb D := D(0,1)$.

\begin{description}
\item[1.]
$f$ is non-constant and holomorphic in the region $\Omega$ and $|f|$
assumes a minimum over $\Omega$ at $z_0$. Show that $f(z_0) = 0$.

\item[2.]
$f$ is holomorphic in $D(0,R)$ and bounded by $M < \infty$. Let
$\sum^\infty_{n=0} c_nz^n$ be its Taylor series at 0. In terms of $N, M$ and
$r$ estimate
$$\left| f(z) - \sum^N_{n=0} c_n z^n \right|$$
in $D(0,r)$, where $r < R$.

{\bf HINT:} ``Cauchy estimates" on the coefficients.

\item[3.]
Let $C$ be the unit circle $\partial \Bbb D$ parameterized in the
customary way. Show that
$$\int_C \frac{e^{\pi z}}{4z^2 + 1} dz = \pi i.$$

\item[4.]
Name four important 19th-century analysts and give a complete statement of
one theorem due to each.

\item[5.]
$S := \Bbb R \times ] - 1, 1$ [and $f$ is holomorphic and bounded in $S$.
Suppose $\lim_{x \to +\infty} f(x) =0$. Show that then
$\lim_{x\ \to +\infty} f(x + iy) = 0$ for every $y \in$\ ] $-1, 1$\ [.

{\bf HINT:} For any sequence of real numbers $x_n \to + \infty$, the
functions $f_n (z) := f(x_n + z)$ constitute a bounded sequence on $S$
which converges to 0 pointwise on $\Bbb R$.

\item[6.]
$f$ is holomorphic and zero-free in the region $\Omega$. Show how to construct
a holomorphic logarithm for $f$, that is, a holomorphic function $g$ in
$\Omega$ such that $f = e^g$. Are any further hypotheses needed on
$\Omega$ to accomplish this?

\item[7.]
$f$ is holomorphic in the annulus $A := \Bbb D \backslash \{0\}$ and
satisfies $|f(z)| < |z|^{\pi /2}$ for all $z \in A$. Show that
$|f(1/2) | \leq 1/4$.

{\bf HINT:} First see if the function $g(z) := f(z)/z$ can be
holomorphically extended into $\Bbb D$. What will its value at 0 have to be?

\item[8.]
$f$ is continuous on $\overline{\Bbb D}$ holomorphic in $\Bbb D$ and vanishes
on some arc of positive length on $\partial \Bbb D$. Show that
$f=0$ throughout $\Bbb D$.

\item[9.]
$f_n$ are holomorphic in the open subset $U$ of $\Bbb C$ and $f_n \to f$
uniformly on each compact subset of $U$. Must $f$ be holomorphic in $U$?
If $U$ is an open subset of $\Bbb R$ and the $f_n$ are differentiable in $U$,
must $f$ be differentiable in $U$?

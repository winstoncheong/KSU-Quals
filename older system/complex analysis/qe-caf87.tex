{\bf NOTATION:} For $a \in {\bf C}$, $ 0< r< \infty$,
$D(a,r) := \{z \in {\bf C} : |z-a| < r \}$, $C(a,r) := \partial D(a,r)$ and
${\bf D} := D(0,1)$. For $G \subset {\bf C}$, $C(G)$ denotes the set of continuous
${\bf C}$-valued functions on $G$ and if $G$ is open, $H(G)$ denotes the set of
holomorphic functinos in $G$.

\begin{description}
\item[1.] (a)
Show by direct calculation that if $G$ is an open set in ${\bf C}$ star-shaped
with respect to a point $z_1$ and $f \in C(G)$ satisfies
$\int_{[z_1, z_2, z_3, z_1]} f=0$ for all points $z_2, z_3$
such that convex hull $\{z_1, z_2, z_3\} \subset G$, then $f$ has a primitive
in $G$; that is, there exists a complex-differentiable $F$ in $G$ with
$F^\prime = f$.

\item[\quad] (b)
Give an example, with proof, of a non-star shaped region $G$ and an
$f \in C(G)$ which satisfies the hypothesis in (a) and which is not $F^\prime$
for any complex-differentiable $F$.

\item[2.]
Let $f$ be meromoprhic in ${\bf C}$, $R_n \uparrow \infty$. Suppose that
$\sup |f(C(0, R_n)) | \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$. For each $\zeta \in {\bf C}$ denote
by $S_n(\zeta)$ the sum of the residues of the function
$z \mapsto \frac{f(z)}{z-\zeta}$ at the poles of $f$ inside
$D(0, R_n)$. Prove that $\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n (\zeta) = f(\zeta)$
uniformly for $\zeta$ in any compact set which is disjoint from the poles of
$f$.

\item[3.]
Let $f$ be holomorphic on some neighborhood of ${\bf D}^-$. If $|f(z)| < 1$ for
all $|z| = 1$, then there exists a unique $z \in {\bf D}$ such that $f(z) = z$.

\item[4.]
Let $I = [0,1]$ and let $f \in C({\bf D} \times I)$. Suppose that for each
$t \in I, z \mapsto f(z,t)$ is holomorphic and has a unique zero $z(t)$ in
${\bf D}$. Prove that $t \mapsto z(t)$ is continuous on $I$.

\item[5.]
Let $\Gamma_n$ be the rectangular path
$$\left[ n + \frac{1}{2} + ni, \quad -n - \frac{1}{2} + ni, \quad
  -n - \frac{1}{2} - ni, \quad n + \frac{1}{2} - ni, \quad n + \frac{1}{2}
  +  ni \right].$$

\item[\quad] (a)
Evaluate the integral
$$\int_{\Gamma_n} \frac{\pi}{(z+a)^2} \cot (\pi z) dz$$
for $a \in {\bf C} \backslash {\bf Z}$.

\item[\quad] (b)
Show that for such $a$
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{\Gamma_n} \frac{\pi}{(z+a)^2} \cot (\pi z)
  dz = 0.$$

{\bf HINT:} Use the fact that for $z= x+ iy$,
$|\cos z|^2 = \cos^2 x + \sin h^2 y$ and $|\sin z|^2 = \sin^2 x + \sin h^2 y$
to show that $|\cot (\pi z) | \leq 2$ for $z$ on $\Gamma_n$ if $n$ is
sufficiently large.

\item[\quad] (c)
Use (a), (b) to deduce that
$$\frac{\pi^2}{\sin^2 (\pi a)} = \sum^\infty_{n = -\infty}
  \frac{1}{(a + n)^2} \quad \forall a \in {\bf C} \backslash {\bf Z}.$$

\item[\quad] (d)
From (c) infer that
$$\frac{\pi^2}{8} = \sum^\infty_{n=0} \frac{1}{(2n + 1)^2}.$$

\item[6.]
State and prove the Liouville theorem.

\item[7.]
Let $S := {\bf R} \times ]a,b[$, with $a,b \in {\bf R}$ and $a<b$. Let
$h \in C(\overline S)$ be holomorphic in $S$. Suppose that
$\sup_y \int^\infty_{-\infty} |h(x+ iy)| dx < \infty$. Show that then
$\int^\infty_{-\infty} h(x+iy) dx$ is independent of $y$.

{\bf Extra Credit:} What is the situation if ``$h$ holomorphic" is weakened
to ``$h$ harmonic".

{\bf HINTS:} Adroit use of Cauchy's theorem. Alternatively, set
$H_n(z) := \int^n_{-n} h(z+ x) dx$ and show that the sequence of holomorphic
functions $\{H_n\}^\infty_{n=1}$ converges locally uniformly in $S$.
Examine the limit function on various horizontal lines in $S$.

\item[8.]
Let  $G \subset {\bf C}$ be a bounded region, $f \in H(G)$, and $z_0 \in \partial G$.
Suppose that $\lim \sup_{z \to w} |f(z)| \leq 1$ for all
$w \in \partial G \backslash \{z_0\}$ and that
$\lim_{z \to z_0} |f(z)| \cdot |z - z_0|^\varepsilon = 0$
for each $\varepsilon > 0$. Prove that $|f(z)| \leq 1$ for all $z \in G$.

\item[9.]
Show that if $f$ is holomorphic in the open set $U$ and one-to-one in
$U \backslash A$, where the points of $A$ are isolated in $U$, then
$f$ is one-to-one in $U$.

{\bf HINT:} This is a result about continuous open maps.

\item[10.]
Let $f, g \in H({\bf D})$. Prove:

\item[\quad] (a)
$|f|$ is subharmonic on ${\bf D}$.

\item[\quad] (b)
If $|f| + |g|$ attains a maximum at some point of ${\bf D}$, then both $f$ and
$g$ are constants.

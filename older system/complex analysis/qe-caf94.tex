\item[1.]
Let $U$ be open $\subset \Bbb C$,  $a \in U$, $f$ holomorphic in
$U \backslash \{a\}$.

\item[\quad] (i)
What does it mean to say $f$ has a pole at $a$?

\item[\quad] (ii)
Show that if $a$ is a pole, then $f(U \backslash \{a\})$ is a ``neighborhood
 of $\infty$", that is, its complement in $\Bbb C$ is compact.

{\bf HINT}: Consider $1/ f(z)$ for $z$ near $a$.

\item[\quad] (iii)
Suppose $f$ has a simple pole at $a$. Prove that
$$\lim_{r \to 0} \int_{\gamma_r} f(z) dz = i \pi Res (f,a),$$
where $\gamma_r (t) := re^{it} + a$ for $r>0$ and $0 \leq t \leq \pi$.

\item[2.]
The holomorphic function $f$ has an isolated singularity at $z_0$ and for
some $a$, $M \in \Bbb R$ satisfies
$$|f(z)| \leq M |z - z_0|^a$$
near $z_0$. Show that

\item[\quad] (i)
$z_0$ is a removable singularity if $a> -1$ and

\item[\quad] (ii)
if $a$ satisfies $-n < a \leq -1$ for some $n \in \Bbb N$, then $z_0$ is a
pole of order at most $n-1$.

{\bf HINT}: Use the Cauchy estimates.

\item[3.]
Suppose $\int_\gamma f=0$ for all piecewise smooth loops $\gamma$ in a region
$\Omega$ and for all holomorphic functions $f$ in $\Omega$. Show how to
{\bf construct} a holomorphic logarithm for any given zero-free holomorphic
function in $\Omega$.

\item[4.]
Explain why the identity function $f(z) := z$ has no holomorphic
logarithm in $\Omega := \{z \in \Bbb C : 0 < |z| < 1\}$.

\item[5.]
$\Omega$ is an open subset of $\Bbb C$ and $f : \Omega \to \Bbb C$ satisfies
$e^{f(z)} = z$ for all $z \in \Omega$ and is continuous on $\Omega$. Show
that $f$ is in fact holomorphic in $\Omega$.

\item[6.]
$f$ is holomorphic by not constant in a neighborhood of $a$ and $f(a) = 0$.
Show that $a$ must be an isolated zero; that is, if $r>0$ is small enough,
$f$ has no zero in $\{0 < |z-a| < r\}$.

{\bf HINT}: Look at the Taylor series of $f$ at $a$.

\item[7.] (i)
The entire function $f$ satisfies
$$z^{-n} f(z) \hbox{\ is\ } \hbox{bounded\ } \hbox{for\ } \hbox{some\ }
  n \in \Bbb N.$$

Show that $f$ is a polynomial of degree no greater than $n$.

{\bf HINT:} Cauchy estimates.

\item[\quad] (ii)
The entire function $F$ satisfies
$$|F(z)| \to \infty \hbox{\ as\ } |z| \to \infty.$$
Show that $F$ is a polynomial.

{\bf HINT:} $F$ has only finitely many zeros (proof?). So for an appropriate
polynomial $P, f := P/F$ satisfies the hypothesis of (i) and it has no zeros.

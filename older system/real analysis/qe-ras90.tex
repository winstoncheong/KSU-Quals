In what follows, $(X, {\cal A}, \mu)$ is a measure space and $\lambda$ is
Lebesgue measure on $\R$.

\begin{description}
\item[1.]
Suppose $f,g: X \to \R$ are ${\cal A}$-measurable.

\item[\quad] (a)
What does it mean to say that $f$ is ${\cal A}$-measurable?

\item[\quad] (b)
Use your definition to prove that $f+g$ is also ${\cal A}$-measurable.

\item[2.]
Suppose that $f:X \to \C$ is ${\cal A}$-measurable,
$\mu(X) < \infty, |f(x)| \leq 1 \forall x \in X$, and
$\int fd\mu = \mu (X)$. Prove that $f(x)=1 \mu$-a.e.

\item[3.]
Let $f \in L_1(\mu)$ and $\varepsilon >0$. Prove that there exists
$\delta >0$ such that
$$A \in {\cal A} \hbox{\ and\ } \mu(A) < \delta \Rightarrow
  \int_A |f| d\mu < \varepsilon.$$

\item[4.]
Apply the Monotone Convergence Theorem to prove Fatou's Lemma.

\item[5.]
Suppose $(X, {\cal A}, \mu)$ is $\sigma$-finite and $f:X \to [0, \infty]$
is ${\cal A}$-measurable. Let
$$E=\{(x,t) \in X \times \R : 0 < t< f(x)\}.$$
Prove that $E \in {\cal A} \times {\cal B} (\R)$ and
$\mu \times \lambda (E) = \int fd\mu$.

\item[6.]
Give examples of each of the following:

\item[\quad] (a)
A closed subset $F$ of $[0,1]$ that contains no rational number and had
$\lambda (F) >0$.

\item[\quad] (b)
A Borel measurable $f:[0,1] \to [0,1]$ such that if $g:[0,1] \to \R$
is Riemann integrable, then
$$\int^{-1}_0 |f(x) - g(x)| dx >0.$$    

\item[7.]
Suppose $f:[a,b] \to \R$ is Lebesgue integrable and
$\int^x_a f(t) dt = 0$ for all $x \in [a,b]$. Prove that $f=0$ a.e.
on $[a,b].$

\item[8.]
Let $a<b$ in $\R$ and let $f:[a,b] \to \R$ be increasing on $[a,b]$. Presuming
it is known that $f$ is differentiable a.e., prove that $f^\prime$ is
Borel measurable and
$$\int^b_a f^\prime (x) dx \leq f(b) - f(a).$$
[Hint: Extend $f$ and use Fatou's Lemma.]

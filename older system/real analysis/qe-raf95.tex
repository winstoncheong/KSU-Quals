\item[1.]
Suppose $f \in L^2 (\mu)$. Prove that
$$\sum^\infty_{n=1} n \mu (\{x \in X : |f(x)| > n\}) < \infty$$

\item[2.]
Suppose $f$ is a $C^\infty$ function on $\Bbb R$ with the property that
for every $x \in \Bbb R$ there exists an $n$ (which many depend on $x$)
so that $\frac{\partial^n f}{\partial x^n} (x) = 0$. Prove that there exists
a nonempty open interval $I$ such that $f|_I$ is a polynomial.


\item[3.]
Suppose  $\psi \in L^1 ([0, \infty))$ is decreasing function on
$[0, \infty)$. For each $n=1,2,3, \dots$ set $f_n(x) = n \psi(nx)$.
Show that $f_n(x) \to 0$ uniformly on the set $[1, \infty)$.

\item[4.]
Suppose $\{f_n\}$ is a sequence of measurable functions on $X$ and $f$ is
measurable on $X$. Discuss the relationship between the conditions $f_n \to f$
a.e. and $f_n \to f$ in measure. You may want to consider the cases
$\mu (X) = \infty$ and $\mu(X) < \infty$ separately.

\item[5.]
Suppose $\mu(X) < \infty$, $f_n \in L^1$, $f_n \to f$ in measure and there
exists $g \in L^1(\mu)$ such that $|f_n| \leq |g|$ a.e. Show that
$f_n \to f$ in $L^1(\mu)$.

\item[6.]
Let $T(x) = \sum^N_{k= -N} a_k e^{ikx}, x \in [-\pi, \pi]$. Prove that
$|a_0| \leq \log \frac{1}{2\pi} \int^\pi_{-\pi} \exp |T(x)|dx$.

\item[7.]
On $(X,M, \mu)$ define $L^\infty(\mu) + L^1(\mu) = \{h + g| h \in L^\infty
   (\mu), g \in L^1(\mu)\}$. Prove that
$L^p(\mu) \subseteq L^\infty (\mu) + L^1(\mu), 1 \leq p \leq \infty$.

\item[8.]
Let $S$ be a linear subspace of $C[0,1]$ which is closed as a subspace of
$L^2[0,1]$. Show that $S$ is a closed subspace of $L^2([0,1])$.

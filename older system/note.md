For analysis, a switch between an old system and new system occurs at Spring 2004.
Prior to Spring 2004, there was both a Real analysis qual and a Complex analysis qual.
Afterwards, some called it the "Real and Complex Analysis qual" and some just the Analysis qual.

The _real and complex analysis_ qual ran from Spring 2004 to Spring 2015.

For algebra, Fall 2003 they switched from some "old" to some "new". Both of which are old.
The algebra ran from Spring 1976 to Spring 2015

The _complex analysis_ qual ran from Fall 1982 to August 2002.
The _real analysis_ qual ran from Fall 1982 to Fall 2003.

The _geometry of manifolds_ qual ran from Fall 1994 to Fall 2003.
For topology, after Fall 2003, the system switches from having Topology and Geometry separate, to them being combined as "Geometry/Topology". The naming is inconsistent afterwards.

The _numerical analysis_ qual ran from Spring 1984 to Fall 2005.
The _PDE / DiffEq_ qual ran from Spring 1984 to Spring 2005.
